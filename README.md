# SimpleDDS
Simple DDS is a simple Driver Drowsiness Detection System algorithm. Projects use Haarcascade eye models to detect the driver's eye-opening degree. If the eyes are closed, an alarm starts to ring to wake up the driver. OpenCV is used for visual analysis and PyQt5 is used for the interface in this project.
